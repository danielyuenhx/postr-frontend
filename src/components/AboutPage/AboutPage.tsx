          <h1>About Postr</h1>
          Welcome to Postr, a social media website to share stories ðŸ“–, updates
          ðŸ“£ and pictures ðŸ“· with the rest of the community! Drawing influences
          from other social media giants, Postr is mainly heavily inspired by
          Reddit, Twitter and Instagram.<br></br>
          <br></br> Postr was made with the intention of being a fun little
          personal project to improve my web development skills. Built by myself
          during my free time with no clear direction to be considered complete,
          it slowly became a passion project to try and include as many cool
          little features as possible. Finally, I feel like it's time to
          consider this project completed. It's far from perfect, but I
          definitely learned a lot building Postr, and I am very happy with how
          it turned out. Thank you for taking the time to check it out!<br></br>
